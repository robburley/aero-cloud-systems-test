## Aero Cloud Systems Test

This project is to demonstrate the use of React in a simple search page with a basic filter.

Note: The author has not used React before this point. 5 Hours of reading and knowledge of Vue Js has made this possible. There will not be best practices or pattens but hopefully this shows some aptitude this learning.

## Instructions

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
